# Project Overview

Welcome to our Healthcare Diagnosis project! This system is designed to assist in determining whether an individual is affected by either influenza or COVID-19 based on provided symptoms. The goal is to offer a quick and preliminary diagnosis to aid healthcare professionals and individuals in making informed decisions regarding further medical attention.

Diagnosis Output: The system analyzes the symptoms and provides a diagnosis, indicating whether the user is likely to have influenza or COVID-19. <br>
Feedback: The user gets feedback based on the diagnostic result.

# Important Note
While this system aims to provide a helpful tool for initial diagnosis, it is crucial to understand that the results generated are based on an artificial dataset. As such, there is a possibility of inaccuracies in the predictions.

# How to Use
